# WarrenWatts-ESET-349-Project-Assembly-Language-Toilet-Paper-Dispenser
My group project in ESET 349, coded in MIPS Assembly Language on the ARM MSP432P401R, for which I was in charge of programming.

Our group was tasked with creating an embedded system with the ARM MSP432P401R and programming it in Assembly. One of our group members had the idea of creating a paper towel/toilet paper dispenser since he wanted to make something that he could take back home with him and utilize if he so wanted. The docs folder contains a circuitry diagram, a program flowchart, and a video displaying the dispenser functioning. It should be noted that the dispenser COULD have been easily programmed to make the stepper motor turn at a much faster rate, there by dispensing toilet paper much more rapidly. However, due to fear that we may break the stepper motor because of the weight loaded onto it by the toilet paper roll, our team decided to make it turn at a slower rate.

The code (displayed in the .txt file) is also very well documented with comments that aid understanding the program.
